        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Bone in chicken thighs are the easiest things to cook. Even if you leave them in too long and go over temperature, you will have to leave them
            in the oven for a long time to make them dry out! The brown sugar adds a slight sweetness that really complements the chicken
