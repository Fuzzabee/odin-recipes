        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Brussels sprouts are a very divisive vegetable. If you've ever tried them, you either loved them or hated them. When I first tried them,
            they were boiled, had no seasoning, and tasted horrid. Once I tried roasted brussels sprouts, though, it was a game changer. Even if you
            have tried them before, I highly recommend trying them again roasted, as they are a completely different food when cooked correctly.

            If you're still not convinced, you can mix these guys with some bacon or drizzle on some honey to create something even more appetizing!
